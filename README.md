# Using Core Data With SwiftUI - An Introduction

## Overview

How does Apple intend for us to use Core Data with SwiftUI?

This project demonstrates how to stitch things together.

It's a single-view app that can

* Persist a list of `BlogIdea`s to a Core Data persistent store
* Use the new `@FetchRequest` property wrapper to fetch `BlogIdea`s
* Use the `@Environment`'s `managedObjectContext` to create and delete `BlogIdea`s
